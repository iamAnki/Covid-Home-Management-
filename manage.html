Most people who become sick with COVID-19 will only experience mild illness and can recover at home. Symptoms might last a few days, and people who have the virus might feel better in about a week. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and includes rest, fluid intake and pain relievers.

However, older adults and people of any age with existing medical conditions should call their doctor as soon as symptoms start. These factors put people at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.

Follow the doctor's recommendations about care and home isolation for yourself or your loved one. Talk to the doctor if you have any questions about treatments. Help the sick person get groceries and any medications and, if needed, take care of his or her pet.

It's also important to consider how caring for a sick person might affect your health. If you are older or have an existing medical condition, such as heart or lung disease or diabetes, you may be at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19. You might consider isolating yourself from the sick person and finding another person to provide care.</li>

<h2>Difference between Mild and Moderate infections </h2>
<h3>Mild Covid </h3>
<p>
Most healthy people who have symptoms will have this form of the illness. The symptoms typically last about 7 to 10 days. And most people with mild COVID-19 get better in 2 to 4 weeks.

Most mild cases will stay mild in severity. However, people with mild illness can take a turn for the worse, sometimes quickly, and this is more likely in vulnerable groups.

The virus mainly affects the large airways in your upper respiratory tract. The lungs are made up of large airways (bronchi that lead into smaller airways (bronchioles) with tiny air sacs on the end (alveoli).

Your lungs contain a fluid called surfactant, which keeps them stretchy and helps keep the air sacs open.

When you have coronavirus, the virus inflames these airways and the severity of the illness appears to depend on the intensity of the inflamamtion and how far into the lungs it extends.

The main symptoms of mild illness are:

temperature
a dry cough
tiredness
loss of sense or taste or smell
feeling slightly breathless
muscle pain
headache
sore throat
diarrhoea
There are a few symptoms that are less common, including runny nose, sore or red eyes, vomiting, diarrhoea and a skin rash. Low mood can also occur, as it does in many viral illnesses.</p>

<h3>Moderate Covid</h3>
<p>
If your illness gets worse, you may become a moderate case - this is common. The majority of people who have moderate COVID-19 recover in 2 to 4 weeks.

People with moderate illness are more breathless and tend to have an increased heart rate, particularly if they’re moving around. This is caused by inflammation further into the lungs, so symptoms like coughing and breathlessness may be worse.

In addition to the symptoms you may get with a mild illness, you may also experience:

a temperature higher than 37.8C
feeling breathless when doing moderate exercise (such as walking up stairs)
soreness from coughing, but no pain
a more persistent cough, several times an hour
a headache, particularly if you’re hot
tiredness and a need to stay in bed
a dry mouth
